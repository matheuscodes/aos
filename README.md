# About

AOS is a web application for organizing personal goals. Based on JavaScript and the Sencha framework, it provides a way for users to organize goals, break down into tasks and log work, in order to be able to quantize their own development and through that learn more about themselves.

The code is live and running at https://aos.cloudcontrolled.com/

Please keep in mind the system uses a double opt-in for registrations and if an account is not confirmed though the registration mail all data will be **mercilessly deleted from the server**. Another note, make sure to always use a secure (HTTPS) connection, there is no detection/redirection feature in place to move from open to secure automatically.

Based on the goals, tasks and logged work, a set of statistics can be calculated. On this tab the user can understand how he stands in relation to the past and planned efforts.

#### Overview

On this top level overview the user can observe some numbers comparing all goals altogether, as well as some reference to the expectations on the current time, to see if things are generally ahead or behind schedule.

Each goal is assigned a colour to be referred in the following statistics. These are always the same, to keep it clear to the user and have an horizontal overview.
